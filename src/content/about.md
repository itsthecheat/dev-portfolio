Growing up in the early days of the internet, I have always been interested in web development. Even in middle school I enjoyed teaching myself HTML and creating my own websites. My interest in y the arts ultimately brought me to studying photography at Pratt institute but I never lost my interest in technology. As I began to work more in commercial and event photography, I found that it did not satisfy me in the ways that I imagined, and began to return to my interest in web development, beginning with a boot camp at General Assembly. During that time I discovered that I especially enjoyed [insert tech stuff I can’t explain] , and this led me to take foundational coursework in computer science at City Tech. Thanks have continued to apply my knowledge to develop my own projects to expand my learning as well as several freelance projects building custom websites.
In short, I am a hard-working professional with 3+ years of experience and a rapidly expanding knowledge of web page content, web platform development, and programming. I am to leverage my skills and passion to successfully fill a web developer role.
